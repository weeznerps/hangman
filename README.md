# Hangman

This is a simple implementation of Flask in hangman

## Setup

To run the app, you will need to have a Python 3 install, and `pip` on your machine.

To install the dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt `

Next, `cd` to the `hangman` directory, run `export FLASK_APP=main.py` and run `flask run` to get the webapp running.

By default it will be deployed at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
